            Inspired by insect compound eyes (CEs) that feature unique optical schemes for imaging, there has recently been growing interest in developing optoelectronic CE cameras with comparable size and functions. However, considering the mismatch between the complex 3D configuration of CEs and the planar nature of available imaging sensors, it is currently challenging to reach this end. Here, we report a paradigm in miniature optoelectronic integrated CE camera by manufacturing polymer CEs with 19{\textasciitilde}160 logarithmic profile ommatidia via femtosecond laser two-photon polymerization. In contrast to μ-CEs with spherical ommatidia that suffer from defocusing problems, the as-obtained μ-CEs with logarithmic ommatidia permit direct integration with a commercial CMOS detector, because the depth-of-field and focus range of all the logarithmic ommatidia are significantly increased. The optoelectronic integrated μ-CE camera enables large field-of-view imaging (90°), spatial position identification and sensitive trajectory monitoring of moving targets. Moreover, the miniature μ-CE camera can be integrated with a microfluidic chip and serves as an on-chip camera for real-time microorganisms monitoring. The insect-scale optoelectronic μ-CE camera provides a practical route for integrating well-developed planar imaging sensors with complex micro-optics elements, holding great promise for cutting-edge applications in endoscopy and robot vision.},

          , 
            The assembly of artificial nanostructured and microstructured materials which display structures and functionalities that mimic nature’s complexity requires building blocks with specific and directional interactions, analogous to those displayed at the molecular level. Despite remarkable progress in synthesizing “patchy” particles encoding anisotropic interactions, most current methods are restricted to integrating up to two compositional patches on a single “molecule” and to objects with simple shapes. Currently, decoupling functionality and shape to achieve full compositional and geometrical programmability remains an elusive task. We use sequential capillarity-assisted particle assembly which uniquely fulfills the demands described above. This is a new method based on simple, yet essential, adaptations to the well-known capillary assembly of particles over topographical templates. Tuning the depth of the assembly sites (traps) and the surface tension of moving droplets of colloidal suspensions enables controlled stepwise filling of traps to “synthesize” colloidal molecules. After deposition and mechanical linkage, the colloidal molecules can be dispersed in a solvent. The template’s shape solely controls the molecule’s geometry, whereas the filling sequence independently determines its composition. No specific surface chemistry is required, and multifunctional molecules with organic and inorganic moieties can be fabricated. We demonstrate the “synthesis” of a library of structures, ranging from dumbbells and triangles to units resembling bar codes, block copolymers, surfactants, and three-dimensional chiral objects. The full programmability of our approach opens up new directions not only for assembling and studying complex materials with single-particle-level control but also for fabricating new microscale devices for sensing, patterning, and delivery applications.},

Identifying and optimizing structures that strongly couple to light is important for understanding the behavior of surface plasmons in small nanoparticle clusters, and can result in highly sensitive chemical and biochemical sensors using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). We use experiment and simulation to examine the local surface plasmon resonances of different arrangements of Ag polyhedral clusters. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that monodisperse, atomically smooth Ag polyhedra can self-assemble into uniform interparticle gaps that result in reproducible SERS enhancement factors from assembly to assembly. We introduce a large-scale, gravity-driven assembly method that can generate arbitrary nanoparticle clusters based on the size and shape of a patterned template. These templates enable the systematic examination of different cluster arrangements and provide a means of constructing scalable and reliable SERS sensors.},

It is shown that gold nanorods can be placed into arrayed 120-nm diameter holes, achieving assembly yields as high as 95\% when the local concentration of nanorods at the receding contact line is suﬃciently high. Regular arrays of gold nanorods have several beneﬁts over randomly deposited nanorod arrangements.

            Capillary‐force‐driven self‐assembly is emerging as a significant approach for the massive manufacture of advanced materials with novel wetting, adhesion, optical, mechanical, or electrical properties. However, academic value and practical applications of the self‐assembly are greatly restricted because traditional micropillar self‐assembly is always unidirectional. In this work, two‐photon‐lithography‐based 4D microprinting is introduced to realize the reversible and bidirectional self‐assembly of microstructures. With asymmetric crosslinking densities, the printed vertical microstructures can switch to a curved state with controlled thickness, curvature, and smooth morphology that are impossible to replicate by traditional 3D‐printing technology. In different evaporating solvents, the 4D‐printed microstructures can experience three states: (I) coalesce into clusters from original vertical states via traditional self‐assembly, (II) remain curved, or (III) arbitrarily self‐assemble (4D self‐assembly) toward the curving directions. Compared to conventional approaches, this 4D self‐assembly is distance‐independent, which can generate varieties of assemblies with a yield as high as 100\%. More importantly, the three states can be reversibly switched, allowing the development of many promising applications such as reversible micropatterns, switchable wetting, and dynamic actuation of microrobots, origami, and encapsulation.},

            Capillary assembly is a versatile method for depositing colloidal particles within templates, resulting in nano/microarrays and colloidal superstructures for optical, plasmonic, and sensory applications. Liquid particles (LPs), comprised of oligomerized 3‐(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate, are herein shown to deposit into patterned cavities via capillary assembly. In contrast to solid colloids, LPs coalesce upon solvent evaporation and assume the geometry of the template. Incorporating small molecules such as dyes followed by LP solidification generates fluorescent polymer microarrays of any geometry. The LP size is inversely proportional to the quantity of deposited material and the convexity of the final polymer array. Cavity filling can be tuned by increasing the assembly temperature. Extraction of the polymerized regions produces solidified particles with faceted shapes including square prisms, trapezoids, and ellipsoids with sizes up to 14 µm that retain the shape of the cavity in which they are initially held. LP deposition thus presents a highly controllable fabrication scheme for geometrically diverse polymer microarrays and anisotropic colloids of any conceivable polygonal shape due to space filling of the template. The extension of capillary assembly to LPs that can be doped with small molecule dyes and analytes invaluably expands the synthetic toolbox for top‐down, scalable, hierarchically engineered materials.},

In this review, the working principles of capillary assembly and its fundamental process parameters are first presented and discussed. We then examine the latest developments in template design and tool optimization to perform capillary assembly in more robust and efficient ways. This is followed by a focus on the broad range of functional materials that have been realized using capillary assembly, from single components to large-scale heterogeneous multi-component assemblies. We then review current applications of capillary assembly, especially in optics, electronics, and in biomaterials. We conclude with a short summary and an outlook for future developments.},

We herein utilize supercritical Faraday waves to drive structural rearrangements between metastable states of few-particle clusters of millimetric spheres bound by capillary attractions at the fluid interface. Using a combination of experiments and theoretical modelling, we demonstrate how the occupation probabilities of different cluster topologies and transition statistics are controlled by the level of the vibrational forcing and the spatial extent of long-range capillary forces. Our results demonstrate how self-assembly dynamics and statistics may be manipulated across scales by controlling the strength of fluctuations and by tuning the properties of the particle interaction-potential.},

              A sustainable society requires high-energy storage devices characterized by lightness, compactness, a long life and superior safety, surpassing current battery and supercapacitor technologies. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), which typically exhibit great toughness, have emerged as promising candidates for innovative energy storage solutions. Here we produced SWCNT ropes wrapped in thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers, and demonstrated experimentally that a twisted rope composed of these SWCNTs possesses the remarkable ability to reversibly store nanomechanical energy. Notably, the gravimetric energy density of these twisted ropes reaches up to 2.1 MJ kg
              −1
              , exceeding the energy storage capacity of mechanical steel springs by over four orders of magnitude and surpassing advanced lithium-ion batteries by a factor of three. In contrast to chemical and electrochemical energy carriers, the nanomechanical energy stored in a twisted SWCNT rope is safe even in hostile environments. This energy does not deplete over time and is accessible at temperatures ranging from −60 to +100 °C.},

In the ﬁrst area, novel mechanical sensors, such as 6-DOF micro-force moment sensors, multi-axis inertial sensors and micro-electrostatic actuators developed with SOI-MEMS technology will be presented. In the second area, we have combined atomic-level simulation and experimental evaluation methods to explain the giant piezoresistive effect in single crystalline SiNWs along different crystallographic orientations.

	abstract = {Metasurfaces, a two-dimensional (2D) form of metamaterials constituted by planar meta-atoms, exhibit exotic abilities to tailor electromagnetic (EM) waves freely. Over the past decade, tremendous efforts have been made to develop various active materials and incorporate them into functional devices for practical applications, pushing the research of tunable metasurfaces to the forefront of nanophotonics. Those active materials include phase change materials (PCMs), semiconductors, transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), ferroelectrics, liquid crystals (LCs), atomically thin material, etc., and enable intriguing performances such as fast switching speed, large modulation depth, ultracompactness, and significant contrast of optical properties under external stimuli. Integration of such materials offers substantial tunability to the conventional passive nanophotonic platforms. Tunable metasurfaces with multifunctionalities triggered by various external stimuli bring in rich degrees of freedom in terms of material choices and device designs to dynamically manipulate and control EM waves on demand. This field has recently flourished with the burgeoning development of physics and design methodologies, particularly those assisted by the emerging machine learning (ML) algorithms. This review outlines recent advances in tunable metasurfaces in terms of the active materials and tuning mechanisms, design methodologies, and practical applications. We conclude this review paper by providing future perspectives in this vibrant and fast-growing research field.},

However, recent LED research includes shrinking individual LED sizes from side lengths {\textgreater}300 µm to values {\textless}100 µm, leading to devices called micro‐LEDs. Their advent creates a number of exciting new application spaces. Here, a review of the principles and applications of micro‐LED technology is presented. In particular, the implications of reduced LED size in necessitating mitigation strategies for nonradiative device edge damage as well as the potential for higher drive current densities are discussed. The opportunities to integrate micro‐LEDs with electronics, and into large‐scale arrays, allow pixel addressable scalable integrated displays, while the small micro‐LED size is ideal for high‐speed modulation for visible light communication, and for integration into biological systems as part of optogenetic therapies.},

	abstract = {Electronic devices with engineered three-dimensional (3D) architectures are indispensable for frictional-force sensing, wide-field optical imaging, and flow velocity measurement. Recent advances in mechanically guided assembly established deterministic routes to 3D structures in high-performance materials, through controlled rolling/folding/buckling deformations. The resulting 3D structures are, however, mostly formed on planar substrates and cannot be transferred directly onto another curved substrate. Here, we introduce an ordered assembly strategy to allow transformation of 2D thin films into sophisticated 3D structures on diverse curved surfaces. The strategy leverages predefined mechanical loadings that deform curved elastomer substrates into flat/cylindrical configurations, followed by an additional uniaxial/biaxial prestretch to drive buckling-guided assembly. Release of predefined loadings results in an ordered assembly that can be accurately captured by mechanics modeling, as illustrated by dozens of complex 3D structures assembled on curved substrates. Demonstrated applications include tunable dipole antennas, flow sensors inside a tube, and integrated electronic systems capable of conformal integration with the heart.

	abstract = {The ever increasing number of wireless devices and systems has led to a crowded spectrum and increased the demand for versatile and multi-functional wireless apparatuses. Recently, metasurfaces have been explored as a prominent technological solution to the current paradigm of spectrum scarcity by opportunistically sharing the spectrum with various users. In general, metasurfaces are passive/dynamic, ultra-compact, multi-functional and programmable structures that are capable of both reciprocal and nonreciprocal signal-wave transmissions. The controllability and programmability of such metasurfaces are governed through DC bias and occasionally a radio-frequency modulation applied to the active components of the unit cells of the metasurface, e.g. diodes and transistors. This article overviews some of the recently proposed passive and dynamic metasurfaces and shows that metasurfaces can enhance the performance of wireless communication systems thanks to their unique physical features such as real-time signal coding, nonreciprocal-beam radiation, nonreciprocal beamsteering amplification and advanced pattern-coding multiple access communication.},

However, typical facial expression recognition (FER) systems are restricted by environments where faces must be clearly seen for computer vision, or rigid devices that are not suitable for the time-dynamic, curvilinear faces. Here, we present a robust, highly wearable FER system that is based on deep-learning-assisted, soft epidermal electronics. The epidermal electronics that can fully conform on faces enable high-fidelity biosignal acquisition without hindering spontaneous facial expressions, releasing the constraint of movement, space, and light. The deep learning method can significantly enhance the recognition accuracy of facial expression types and intensities based on a small sample. The proposed wearable FER system is superior for wide applicability and high accuracy. The FER system is suitable for the individual and shows essential robustness to different light, occlusion, and various face poses. It is totally different from but complementary to the computer vision technology that is merely suitable for simultaneous FER of multiple individuals in a specific place. This wearable FER system is successfully applied to human-avatar emotion interaction and verbal communication disambiguation in a real-life environment, enabling promising human-computer interaction applications.},

Here, a laser projection proximity transfer (LaserPPT) technique is presented, which assembles the microchips in an approach-and-release manner, combining high-precision parallelism with individual chip control. An embedded carbon layer with a thin gas layer is generated by an ultraviolet laser, followed by absorbing heat from the infrared laser, to enable the sequential expansion of hierarchical “gas-needles.” The level 1 large gas-needle with a substantially growing height can reduce the gap between the microchip and the receiver. Then, the level 2 small gas-needles enable the gentle release of a chip. Therefore, the LaserPPT can obtain a strong adhesion modulation ({\textasciitilde}1000 times), excellent size scalability ({\textless}100 micrometers), and high transfer accuracy of {\textasciitilde}4 micrometers. Last, the assembly of a micro–light-emitting diode display demonstrates the capabilities for deterministic assembly of microarrays.

The basis is a fluidic self-assembly technique in which capillary forces assemble microparts with submicrometer alignment precision. A heat-curable acrylate-based adhesive is used to provide the capillary forces for assembly and is then polymerized in a bath of water at 80 C for 16 h with continuous nitrogen bubbling. The application we describe is self-assembly of flat silicon micromirrors onto surface-micromachined actuators for use in an adaptive-optics mirror array. Photolithography defines shapes of hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers for self-assembly. Mirrors with fill factors up to 95\% were assembled. Mirrors 464 m in diameter and assembled onto actuators remain flat to within 6 nm rms. This mirror quality would be difficult to attain without the process decoupling afforded by microassembly. The general self-assembly approach described here can be applied to parts ranging in size from the nanometer to the millimeter scale and to a variety of part and substrate materials.},

              BACKGROUND
              Future high-performance portable and wearable optical devices and systems with small footprints and low weights will require components with small form factors and enhanced functionality. Planar components based on diffractive optics (e.g., gratings, Fresnel lenses) and thin-film optics (e.g., dielectric filters, Bragg reflectors) have been around for decades; however, their limited functionality and difficulty of integration have been key incentives to search for better alternatives. Owing to its potential for vertical integration and marked design flexibility, metasurface-based flat optics provides a rare opportunity to overcome these challenges. The building blocks (BBs) of metasurfaces are subwavelength-spaced scatterers. By suitably adjusting their shape, size, position, and orientation with high spatial resolution, one can control the basic properties of light (phase, amplitude, polarization) and thus engineer its wavefront at will. This possibility greatly expands the frontiers of optical design by enabling multifunctional components with attendant reduction of thickness, size, and complexity.
            
            
              ADVANCES
              Recent progress in fabrication techniques and in the theory and design of metasurfaces holds promise for this new optical platform (metaoptics) to replace or complement conventional components in many applications. One major advance has been the migration to all-dielectric metasurfaces. Here, we discuss the key advantages of using dielectric phase-shifting elements with low optical loss and strong light confinement in the visible and near-infrared regions as BBs of flat lenses (metalenses). High–numerical aperture metalenses that are free of spherical aberrations have been implemented to achieve diffraction-limited focusing with subwavelength resolution, without requiring the complex shapes of aspherical lenses. Achromatic metalenses at discrete wavelengths and over a bandwidth have been realized by dispersion engineering of the phase shifters. By suitably adjusting the geometrical parameters of the latter, one can impart polarization- and wavelength-dependent phases to realize multifunctional metalenses with only one ultrathin layer. For example, polarization-sensitive flat lenses for chiral imaging and circular dichroism spectroscopy with high resolution have been realized, and off-axis metalenses with large engineered angular dispersion have been used to demonstrate miniature spectrometers. The fabrication of metalenses is straightforward and often requires one-step lithography, which can be based on high-throughput techniques such as deep-ultraviolet and nanoimprint lithography.
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              In the near future, the ability to fabricate metalenses and other metaoptical components with a planar process using the same lithographic tools for manufacturing integrated circuits (ICs) will have far-reaching implications. We envision that camera modules widely employed in cell phones, laptops, and myriad applications will become thinner and easier to optically align and package, with metalenses and the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor–compatible sensor manufactured by the same foundries. The unprecedented design freedom of metalenses and other metasurface optical components will greatly expand the range of applications of micro-optics and integrated optics. We foresee a rapidly increasing density of nanoscale optical elements on metasurface-based chips, with attendant marked increases in performance and number of functionalities. Such digital optics will probably follow a Moore-like law, similar to that governing the scaling of ICs, leading to a wide range of high-volume applications.

            A method for high‐throughput 3D self‐assembly of 2D photopatterned microstructures using railed microfluidics is presented. Vertical device patterning of heterogeneous materials requires high‐level integration using conventional microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology; however, 3D railed assembly enables easy and fast self‐assembly via a fluidic axis‐translation process and simple material exchange in microfluidic channels. Individually photopatterned 2D microstructures are axis‐translated from in‐plane to out‐of‐plane and fluidically self‐assembled, guided by side‐rails in microfluidic channels to form a 3D morphology. Since the structures are fabricated in fluidic environments, there are no fixed initial points on the channel substrate allowing fluidic horizontal stacking of erected 2D structures. The guiding mechanism of railed microfluidics enables efficient fluidic handling and deterministic 3D self‐assembly of heterogeneous components such as electronic components or polymeric microstructures using only fluidic force.},

The hexagons and templates (collectively, “pieces”) were fabricated via standard procedures and patterned into hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Templated self-assembly occurs in water through capillary interactions between thin films of a nonpolar liquid adhesive coating the hydrophobic faces of the pieces. The hexagons tile the cavities enclosed by the templates, and the boundaries of the cavities determine the sizes and shapes of the assemblies. Curing the adhesive with ultraviolet light furnishes mechanically stable arrays having well-defined morphologies. By allowing control over the structures of the resulting aggregates, this work represents a step toward the development of practical methods for microfabrication based on self-assembly.},

            The instabilities of fluid interfaces represent both a limitation and an opportunity for the fabrication of small-scale devices. Just as non-uniform capillary pressures can destroy micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS), so they can guide the assembly of novel solid and fluid structures. In many such applications the interface appears during an evaporation process and is therefore only present temporarily. It is commonly assumed that this evaporation simply guides the interface through a sequence of equilibrium configurations, and that the rate of evaporation only sets the timescale of this sequence. Here, we use Lattice-Boltzmann simulations and a theoretical analysis to show that, in fact, the rate of evaporation can be a factor in determining the onset and form of dynamical capillary instabilities. Our results shed light on the role of evaporation in previous experiments, and open the possibility of exploiting diffusive mass transfer to directly control capillary flows in MEMS applications.},

This solder shell enables fluidic self-assembly and self-alignment of freely in water suspended Si-dies at relatively low temperature (75 °C) leading to well-ordered chip arrays. The reduction of the free surface energy of the shell-water interface provides the driving force for the self-assembly. The lowermost metal layer is a high melting point solder and acts as a core. After the self-assembly is complete, a short reflow causes the transformation of the core and the shell yielding a stable high melting point solder with adjustable melting points. The chosen ternary solder system enables the realization of interconnects with melting points in the range of 112 °C to 206 °C.},

In the process flow of micro-LED, the step known as mass transfer that requires transferring millions of micro-LEDs from a growth substrate to a display plane, is one of the key challenges limiting the commercialization of micro-LED from laboratory. Worldwide academic and industrial efforts have been devoted to developing mass transfer strategies with purposes of improving yield and reducing cost. Herein we review three main categories of mass transfer technologies for micro-LED display (pick-and-place, fluid self-assembly and laser-enabled advanced placement) and the coupled detection and repair technologies after transfer. Discussions and comparisons have been provided about the underlying general principle, history, and representative parties, advantages, and disadvantages (yield/efficiency/cost) of these technologies.

          , 
            Soft materials made from braided or woven microscale fibers can display unique properties that can be exploited in electromagnetic, mechanical, and biomedical applications. These properties depend on the topology of the braids or weaves—that is, the order in which fibers cross one another. Current industrial braiding and weaving machines cannot easily braid or weave micrometer-scale fibers into controllable topologies; they typically apply forces that are large enough to break the fibers, and each machine can typically make only one topology. Here we use a 3D-printed device called a “capillary machine” to manipulate micrometer-scale fibers without breaking them. The operating principle is the physics of capillary forces: as the machines move vertically, they exert lateral capillary forces on floating objects, which in turn move small fibers connected to them. We present a new type of capillary machine that is based on principles of braid theory. It implements all the possible fiber-swapping operations for a set of four fibers and can therefore make any four-strand topology, including braids, twists, hierarchical twists, and weaves. We make these different topologies by changing the pattern of vertical motion of the machine. This approach is a mechanically simple, yet versatile way to make micro- and nano-textiles. We describe the prospects and limitations of this new type of machine for applications.},

Such competing interactions enable a variety of pairwise equilibrium states, including the possibility of a local minimum energy corresponding to a finite disk spacing. Two-dimensional (2D) experiments and simulations in confined geometries demonstrate that as the areal packing fraction is increased, the dilute repulsion-dominated lattice state becomes unstable to the spontaneous formation of localized clusters, which eventually merge into a systemspanning striped pattern. Finally, we demonstrate that the equilibrium pattern can be externally manipulated by the application of a supplemental vertical magnetic force that remotely enhances the effective capillary attraction.},

            Microactuators provide controllable driving forces for precise positioning, manipulation and operation at the microscale. Development of microactuators using active materials is often hampered by their fabrication complexity and limited motion at small scales. Here we report light-fuelled artificial goosebumps to actuate passive microstructures, inspired by the natural reaction of hair bristling (piloerection) on biological skin. We use light-responsive liquid crystal elastomers as the responsive artificial skin to move three-dimensionally printed passive polymer microstructures. When exposed to a programmable femtosecond laser, the liquid crystal elastomer skin generates localized artificial goosebumps, resulting in precise actuation of the surrounding microstructures. Such microactuation can tilt micro-mirrors for the controlled manipulation of light reflection and disassemble capillary-force-induced self-assembled microstructures globally and locally. We demonstrate the potential application of the proposed microactuation system for information storage. This methodology provides precise, localized and controllable manipulation of microstructures, opening new possibilities for the development of programmable micromachines.},

Although conventional silicon-based nanofabrication (top-down approach) has developed into a technique with extremely high precision and integration density, nanofabrication based on directed assembly (bottom-up approach) is attracting more interest recently owing to its low cost and the advantages of additive manufacturing. Directed assembly is a process that utilizes external fields to directly interact with nanoelements (nanoparticles, 2D nanomaterials, nanotubes, nanowires, etc.) and drive the nanoelements to site-selectively assemble in patterned areas on substrates to form functional structures. Directed assembly processes can be divided into four different categories depending on the external fields: electric field-directed assembly, fluidic flowdirected assembly, magnetic field-directed assembly, and optical field-directed assembly. In this review, we summarize recent progress utilizing these four processes and address how these directed assembly processes harness the external fields, the underlying mechanism of how the external fields interact with the nanoelements, and the advantages and drawbacks of utilizing each method. Finally, we discuss applications made using directed assembly and provide a perspective on the future developments and challenges.},

          Manipulation of floating objects, whether solid or liquid, spanning from microscopic to mesoscopic sizes, is crucial in various microfluidics and microfabrication applications. While capillary menisci naturally self-assemble and transport floating particles, their shapes and sizes are limited by the properties of the fluid and the objects involved. We herein introduce an innovative and versatile method that harnesses the superposition of capillary menisci to curve liquid interfaces without size limit. By using 3D-printed spines piercing the interface, we can finely adjust height gradients across the liquid surface to create any liquid topography at low cost. Thus, our method becomes a powerful tool for manipulating floating objects of all sizes. Combining experimental demonstrations and theoretical modeling, we study the liquid elevation created by specific spine dispositions and the three-dimensional manipulation of submillimetric particles. Multiple examples showcase the method's potential applications, including sorting and capturing particles, which could pave the way for cleaning fluid interfaces.},

              Nanogap plasmonic structures, which can strongly enhance electromagnetic fields, enable widespread applications in surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sensing. Although the directed self‐assembly strategy has been adopted for the fabrication of micro/nanostructures on open surfaces, fabrication of nanogap plasmonic structures on complex substrates or at designated locations still remains a grand challenge. Here, a switchable self‐assembly method is developed to manufacture 3D nanogap plasmonic structures by combining supercritical drying and capillary‐force driven self‐assembly (CFSA) of micropillars fabricated by laser printing. The polymer pillars can stay upright during solvent development via supercritical drying, and then can form the nanogap after metal coating and subsequent CFSA. Due to the excellent flexibility of this method, diverse patterned plasmonic nanogap structures can be fabricated on planar or nonplanar substrates for SERS. The measured SERS signals of different patterned nanogaps in fluidic environment show a maximum enhancement factor ≈8 × 10
              7
              . Such nanostructures in microchannels also allow localized sensing for anticancer drugs (doxorubicin). Resulting from the marriage of top‐down and self‐assembly techniques, this method provides a facile, effective, and controllable approach for creating nanogap enabled SERS devices in fluidic channels, and hence can advance applications in precision medicine.},

Preferential self-assembly of multiple microcomponent types onto a common platform is achieved through complementary shape recognition and aided by capillary, fluidic, and gravitational forces. We outline a microfabrication process that yields single-crystal, silicon FETs in a freestanding, powder-like collection for use with self-assembly.

The process takes place at the triple interface between silicone oil, water, and a penetrating solder-patterned substrate. The assembly is driven by a stepwise reduction of interfacial free energy where chips are first collected and preoriented at an oil-water interface before they assemble on a solder-patterned substrate that is pulled through the interface. Patterned transfer occurs in a progressing linear front as the liquid layers recede. The process eliminates the dependency on gravity and sedimentation of prior methods, thereby extending the minimal chip size to the sub-100 micrometer scale. It provides a new route for the field of printable electronics to enable the integration of microscopic high performance inorganic semiconductors on foreign substrates with the freedom to choose target location, pitch, and integration density. As an example we demonstrate a fault-tolerant segmented flexible monocrystalline silicon solar cell, reducing the amount of Si that is used when compared to conventional rigid cells.},

	abstract = {A significant limitation for droplet mobility on solid surfaces is to overcome the inherent pinning of the droplet’s contact line that occurs due to chemical/physical heterogeneities. A recent innovation is to use surface texture or porosity to create a stabilised lubricant surface. Droplets on such Slippery Liquid Infused Porous Surfaces/Lubricant Impregnated Surfaces (SLIPS/LIS) are highly mobile due to the lubricant layer. Low pinning of the contact line reduces the energy required to move a droplet, however, it makes it difficult to accurately position the droplet or to stop its motion altogether. In this paper, a simple structure (step), as small as a few microns in height, is used to introduce controlled droplet pinning on a slippery substrate. The key effect is identified as the capillary force, arising from the interaction between the lubricant menisci created by the step and droplet. The effect of changing step height, lubricant thickness and initial position on step-droplet interactions has been investigated, showing droplets can both be repelled from and attracted to the step. To measure the adhesion strength, we report droplet detachment angle measurements under gravity, and scaling of force with lubricant thickness/step height ratio. Under certain conditions, the interaction strength is sufficient to ensure droplet-step attachment even when the surface is rotated to an upside-down orientation. These findings presented can motivate the design of SLIPS structures, capable of shedding or retaining droplets preferentially, e.g., according to size or wettability, relevant to applications from microfluidics to fog harvesting.},

The macro-patterning produces menisci features in the impregnating liquid layer which interact with a droplet via a capillary mechanism similar to the Cheerios effect. These interactions control the droplet motion and positioning on an otherwise completely slippery surface. We present experimental results using a V-shape channel geometry as a model system. The interaction between deformations on the lubricant layer induced by the droplet and the underlying V-shape geometry leads to both local and global equilibrium positions for the droplet within the channel. We present a mathematical model to quantify the transition from local equilibrium states to the global equilibrium state and show that the latter can be described on the basis of a force balance along the apparent contact line of the droplet. We highlight possible applications where lubricated macro-patterned surfaces can be used to control the motion and localisation of droplets.},

	abstract = {In the sliding contact between the fingerpad and a rough surface when touching a product’s surface, friction plays a role in the perception of roughness, slipperiness and warmth. For product engineers who aim to control and optimize the sensorial properties of a product surface interacting with the skin, it is essential to understand this frictional behaviour. However, the friction of skin is yet poorly understood. The variation that is observed within or between skin friction studies can be assigned to gender, age and orientation of the finger. Analysing data collected from literature shows some consistent trends. The coefficient of friction increases considerably with increasing hydration level of the skin, due to softening of the top layer of the skin. The coefficient of friction of the fingerpad decreases with normal load to a constant value, which can be attributed to effects of normal adhesion and the deformation behaviour of the fingerpad. There is no consistent effect of velocity on the coefficient of friction. Friction decreases with increasing Ra roughness. When the Ra roughness increases further, the contribution of deformation causes an increase in the friction after which it remains constant. Some influence of the finishing method is reported. The type of material has a smaller influence than the surface roughness of the sample or the condition of the skin. Even though the coefficient of friction of the fingerpad shows some consistent trends, examining the friction behaviour at a more detailed level might explain the contribution of friction to tactile perception. The measuring signal contains relevant information and should be analysed thoroughly as opposed to taking the average coefficient of friction of the steady state part of the signal. Future work should involve the study of local friction behaviour at the scale of the surface roughness.},

	abstract = {Gloss is a relatively little studied visual property of objects’ surfaces. The earliest recorded scientiﬁc reference to gloss appears to have been by Ingersoll in 1921: studies at this time were based on the assumption that gloss could be understood as an inherent physical property of a surface, and the priority was to devise a satisfactory method and scale to measure it reliably. As awareness of the complexity of perception grew, efforts were made to distinguish different types of gloss, although these generally still took the form of a search for objective physical measures to be solved within the visual system by means of inverse optics. It became more widely recognised approximately 20 years ago that models of gloss perception based on inverse optics were intractable and failed to explain experimental ﬁndings adequately. A temporary decline in the number of published studies followed; however the last decade or so has seen a renewal of interest in the perception of gloss, in an effort to map what is now understood to be a complex interaction of variables including illumination, surface properties and observer. This appears to have been driven by a number of factors, as the study of gloss re-emerged from research into other surface properties such as colour and texture, with technological advances paving the way for new experimental techniques and measurements. This review describes the main strands of research, tracking the changes in approach and theory which have triggered new avenues of research, to the current state of knowledge. Ó 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

              Scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution
              1,2
              with the immutable laws of the Universe defined by physics. These laws underpin life’s origin, evolution and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena. Evolutionary theory explains why some things exist and others do not through the lens of selection. To comprehend how diverse, open-ended forms can emerge from physics without an inherent design blueprint, a new approach to understanding and quantifying selection is necessary
              3–5
              . We present assembly theory (AT) as a framework that does not alter the laws of physics, but redefines the concept of an ‘object’ on which these laws act. AT conceptualizes objects not as point particles, but as entities defined by their possible formation histories. This allows objects to show evidence of selection, within well-defined boundaries of individuals or selected units. We introduce a measure called assembly (
              A
              ), capturing the degree of causation required to produce a given ensemble of objects. This approach enables us to incorporate novelty generation and selection into the physics of complex objects. It explains how these objects can be characterized through a forward dynamical process considering their assembly. By reimagining the concept of matter within assembly spaces, AT provides a powerful interface between physics and biology. It discloses a new aspect of physics emerging at the chemical scale, whereby history and causal contingency influence what exists.},

	abstract = {Viruses avoid exposure of the viral genome to harmful agents with the help of a protective protein shell known as the capsid. A secondary eﬀect of this protective barrier is that macromolecules that may be in high concentration on the outside cannot freely diﬀuse across it. Therefore, inside the cell and possibly even outside, the intact virus is generally under a state of osmotic stress. Viruses deal with this type of stress in various ways. In some cases, they might harness it for infection. However, the magnitude and inﬂuence of osmotic stress on virus physical properties remains virtually unexplored for single-stranded RNA virusesthe most abundant class of viruses. Here, we report on how a model system for the positive-sense RNA icosahedral viruses, brome mosaic virus (BMV), responds to osmotic pressure. Speciﬁcally, we study the mechanical properties and structural stability of BMV under controlled molecular crowding conditions. We show that BMV is mechanically reinforced under a small external osmotic pressure but starts to yield after a threshold pressure is reached. We explain this mechanochemical behavior as an eﬀect of the molecular crowding on the entropy of the “breathing” ﬂuctuation modes of the virus shell. The experimental results are consistent with the viral RNA imposing a small negative internal osmotic pressure that prestresses the capsid. Our ﬁndings add a new line of inquiry to be considered when addressing the mechanisms of viral disassembly inside the crowded environment of the cell.},

	abstract = {Displays based on inorganic light-emitting diodes (LED) are considered as the most promising one among the display technologies for the next-generation. The chip for LED display bears similar features to those currently in use for general lighting, but it size is shrunk to below 200 microns. Thus, the advantages of high efﬁciency and long life span of conventional LED chips are inherited by miniaturized ones. As the size gets smaller, the resolution enhances, but at the expense of elevating the complexity of fabrication. In this review, we introduce two sorts of inorganic LED displays, namely relatively large and small varieties. The mini-LEDs with chip sizes ranging from 100 to 200 µm have already been commercialized for backlight sources in consumer electronics applications. The realized local diming can greatly improve the contrast ratio at relatively low energy consumptions. The micro-LEDs with chip size less than 100 µm, still remain in the laboratory. The full-color solution, one of the key technologies along with its three main components, red, green, and blue chips, as well color conversion, and optical lens synthesis, are introduced in detail. Moreover, this review provides an account for contemporary technologies as well as a clear view of inorganic and miniaturized LED displays for the display community.},

Despite extensive progress, current top-down methods are based on directional line-ofsight fabrication mechanisms that are limited by scale and cannot be applied to highly uneven, curved, and enclosed surfaces, while bottom-up techniques often suﬀer from poor optical transparency. Here, we present an approach that enables the rapid, omnidirectional synthesis of ﬂexible and up to 99.97\% transparent superhydrophobic and -oleophobic textures on many variable surface types. These features are obtained by the spontaneous formation of a multi re-entrant morphology during the controlled selfassembly of nanoparticle aerosols. We also develop a mathematical model to explain and control the self-assembly dynamics, providing important insights for the rational engineering of functional materials. We envision that our ﬁndings represent a signiﬁcant advance in imparting superoleophobicity and superamphiphobicity to a so-far inapplicable family of materials and geometries for multifunctional applications.},

When an object presses on the skin, the skin distorts to take on the shape of the object’s surface. When viewed from behind (through the elastomer slab), the skin appears as a relief replica of the surface. A camera records an image of this relief, using illumination from red, green, and blue light sources at three different positions. A photometric stereo algorithm that is tailored to the device is then used to reconstruct the surface. There is no problem dealing with transparent or specular materials because the skin supplies its own BRDF. Complete information is recorded in a single frame; therefore we can record video of the changing deformation of the skin, and then generate an animation of the changing surface. Our sensor has no moving parts (other than the elastomer slab), uses inexpensive materials, and can be made into a portable device that can be used “in the ﬁeld” to record surface shape and texture.},

The formation of these structures involves nucleation and self-assembly, which are fundamental physical processes associated with the formation of any ordered structure. It is important to understand how biogenic materials self-assemble into functional and highly ordered structures in order to determine the mechanisms of biological systems, as well as design and produce new classes of materials which are inspired by nature but equipped with better physiochemical properties for our purposes. An ideal tool for the study of nucleation and self-assembly is in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), which has been widely used in this ﬁeld and further developed for different applications in recent years. The main aim of this work is to review the latest contributions that have been reported on studies of nucleation and self-assembly of biogenic and bio-inspired materials using in situ AFM. We will address this topic by introducing the background of AFM, and discussing recent in situ AFM studies on nucleation and self-assembly of soft biogenic, soft bioinspired and hard materials.},

Unlike many other bacteria which adhere through an extended extracellular polymeric network, the holdfast footprint area is tens of thousands times smaller than that of the total bacterium crosssectional surface, making for some very demanding adhesion requirements. At present, the mechanism of holdfast adhesion remains poorly understood. We explore it here along three lines of investigation: (a) the impact of environmental conditions on holdfast binding aﬃnity, (b) adhesion kinetics by dynamic force spectroscopy, and (c) kinetic modeling of the attachment process to interpret the observed time-dependence of the adhesion force at short and long time scales. A picture emerged in which discrete molecular units called adhesins are responsible for initial holdfast adhesion, by acting in a cooperative manner.},

In atomic force microscopy (AFM) the probe is a nanometric tip located at the end of a micro cantilever which palpates the specimen under study as a blind person manages a walking stick. In this way AFM allows obtaining nanometric resolution images of individual protein shells, such as viruses, in liquid milieu. Beyond imaging, AFM also enables not only the manipulation of single protein cages, but also the characterization of every physicochemical property able of inducing any measurable mechanical perturbation to the microcantilever that holds the tip. In this chapter we start revising some recipes for adsorbing protein shells on surfaces. Then we describe several AFM approaches to study individual protein cages, ranging from imaging to spectroscopic methodologies devoted for extracting physical information, such as mechanical and electrostatic properties. We also explain how a convenient combination of AFM and ﬂuorescence methodologies entails monitoring genome release from individual viral shells during mechanical unpacking.},

Because the technique can also work in a liquid environment it offers unique possibilities to study individual viruses under conditions that mimic their natural milieu. Here, we review how AFM imaging can be used to study the surface structure of viruses including that of viruses lacking a well-deﬁned symmetry. Beyond imaging, AFM enables the manipulation of single viruses by force spectroscopy experiments. Pulling experiments can provide information about the early events of virus–host interaction between the viral ﬁbers and the cell membrane receptors. Pushing experiments measure the mechanical response of the viral capsid and its contents and can be used to show how virus maturation and exposure to different pH values change the mechanical response of the viruses and the interaction between the capsid and genome. Finally, we discuss how studying capsid rupture and self-healing events offers insight in virus uncoating pathways.},

But because assembly is a collective phenomenon involving many weakly interacting subunits and a broad range of timescales, measurements of the assembly pathways have been elusive. We use interferometric scattering microscopy to measure the assembly kinetics of individual MS2 bacteriophage capsids around MS2 RNA. By recording how many coat proteins bind to each of many individual RNA strands, we find that assembly proceeds by nucleation followed by monotonic growth. Our measurements reveal the assembly pathways in quantitative detail and also show their failure modes. We use these results to critically examine models of the assembly process.},

While for theta = 30, theta = 40 (no flow) and theta = 60 (flow) all methods are found to produce data consistent with the CF criterion, at theta = 50 the numerical experiments provide different results. Whilst pinning of the liquid front is observed both in the LB and CFD simulations, MD simulations show that molecular fluctuations allow front propagation even above the critical value predicted by the deterministic CF criterion, thereby introducing a sensitivity to the obstacle heigth.},

	abstract = {This work analyzes the role of hydrocarbon ligands in the self-assembly of nanocrystal (NC) superlattices. Typical NCs, composed of an inorganic core of radius R and a layer of capping ligands with length L, can be described as soft spheres with softness parameter L/R. Using particle tracking measurements of transmission electron microscopy images, we ﬁnd that close-packed NCs, like their hard-sphere counterparts, ﬁll space at approximately 74\% density independent of softness. We uncover deformability of the ligand capping layer that leads to variable eﬀective NC size in response to the coordination environment. This eﬀect plays an important role in the packing of particles in binary nanocrystal superlattices (BNSLs). Measurements on BNSLs composed of NCs of varying softness in several coordination geometries indicate that NCs deform to produce dense BNSLs that would otherwise be lowdensity arrangements if the particles remained spherical. Consequently, rationalizing the mixing of two NC species during BNSL self-assembly need not employ complex energetic interactions. We summarize our analysis in a set of packing rules. These ﬁndings contribute to a general understanding of entropic eﬀects during crystallization of deformable objects (e.g., nanoparticles, micelles, globular proteins) that can adapt their shape to the local coordination environment.},

	abstract = {The structure of ﬁnite self-assembling systems depends sensitively on the number of constituent building blocks. Recently, it was demonstrated that hard sphere-like colloidal particles show a magic number eﬀect when conﬁned in emulsion droplets. Geometric construction rules permit a few dozen magic numbers that correspond to a discrete series of completely ﬁlled concentric icosahedral shells. Here, we investigate the free energy landscape of these colloidal clusters as a function of the number of their constituent building blocks for system sizes up to several thousand particles. We ﬁnd that minima in the free energy landscape, arising from the presence of ﬁlled, concentric shells, are signiﬁcantly broadened, compared to their atomic analogues. Colloidal clusters in spherical conﬁnement can ﬂexibly accommodate excess particles by ordering icosahedrally in the cluster center while changing the structure near the cluster surface. In between these magic number regions, the building blocks cannot arrange into ﬁlled shells. Instead, we observe that defects accumulate in a single wedge and therefore only aﬀect a few tetrahedral grains of the cluster. We predict the existence of this wedge by simulation and conﬁrm its presence in experiment using electron tomography. The introduction of the wedge minimizes the free energy penalty by conﬁning defects to small regions within the cluster. In addition, the remaining ordered tetrahedral grains can relax internal strain by breaking icosahedral symmetry. Our ﬁndings demonstrate how multiple defect mechanisms collude to form the complex free energy landscape of colloidal clusters.},

Inventor Created Better Way to Carry Eggs. In The Globe and Mail Vancouver, 2013). In this article, we extend Coyle’s old idea to the study of mechanical properties of viruses. Virus stiﬀness, strength, and breaking force obtained by force spectroscopy atomic force microscopy (AFM) provide the knowledge required for designing nanocontainers for applications in biotechnology and medicine, and for understanding the fundamentals of virus−host interaction such as virus translocation from one cellular compartment to another. In previous studies, virus particles adsorbed on ﬂat surfaces from a physiological buﬀer were subjected to directional deformation by a known force exerted via a microscopic probe. The aﬃnity between the virus shell and surface is required to be strong enough to anchor particles on the substrate while they are indented or imaged, yet suﬃciently weak to preserve the native structure and interactions prior deformation. The speciﬁc question addressed here is whether an experimental scheme characterized by increased contact area and stable mechanical equilibrium under directional compression would provide a more reliable characterization than the traditional ﬂat substrate approach.},

	abstract = {Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a promising gene therapy vector. To make progress in this direction, the relationship between the characteristics of the genomic cargo and the capsid stability must be understood in detail. The goal of this study is to determine the role of the packaged vector genome in the response of AAV particles to mechanical compression and adhesion to a substrate. Speciﬁcally, we used atomic force microscopy to compare the mechanical properties of empty AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) capsids and AAV2 vectors packaging single-stranded DNA or self-complementary DNA. We found that all species underwent partial deformation upon adsorption from buﬀer on an atomically ﬂat graphite surface. Upon adsorption, a preferred orientation toward the twofold symmetry axis on the capsid, relative to the substrate, was observed. The magnitude of the bias depended on the cargo type, indicating that the interfacial properties may be inﬂuenced by cargo. All particles showed a signiﬁcant relative strain before rupture. Diﬀerent from interfacial interactions, which were clearly cargo-dependent, the elastic response to directional stress was largely dominated by the capsid properties. Nevertheless, small diﬀerences between particles laden with diﬀerent cargo were measurable; scAAV vectors were the most resilient to external compression. We also show how elastic constant and rupture force data sets can be analyzed according a multivariate conditional probability approach to determine the genome content on the basis of a database of mechanical properties acquired from nanoindentation assays. Implications for understanding how recombinant AAV capsid−genome interactions can aﬀect vector stability and eﬀectiveness of gene therapy applications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Viruses undergo mesoscopic morphological changes as they interact with host interfaces and in response to chemical cues. The dynamics of these changes, over the entire temporal range relevant to virus processes, are unclear. Here, we report on creep compliance experiments on a small icosahedral virus under uniaxial constant stress. We ﬁnd that even at small stresses, well below the yielding point and generally thought to induce a Hookean response, strain continues to develop in time via sparse, randomly distributed, relatively rapid plastic events. The intermittent character of mechanical compliance only appears above a loading threshold, similar to situations encountered in granular ﬂows and the plastic deformation of crystalline solids. The threshold load is much smaller for the empty capsids of the brome mosaic virus than for the wild-type virions. The diﬀerence highlights the involvement of RNA in stabilizing the assembly interface. Numerical simulations of spherical crystal deformation suggest intermittency is mediated by lattice defect dynamics and identify the type of compression-induced defect that nucleates the transition to plasticity.},

Next, soft lithographic micropatterning techniques are used to fabricate a microscale in vitro device to house the 3D microorgan. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of the DCW process for freeform biofabrication of 3D cell-encapsulated hydrogel-based tissue constructs with deﬁned reproducible patterns, direct integration of 3D constructs onto a microﬂuidic device for continuous perfusion drug ﬂow, and characterization of 3D tissue constructs with predictable cell viability/ proliferation outcomes and enhanced functionality over traditional culture methods.},

	abstract = {Tissue engineering has been a promising field of research, offering hope for bridging the gap between organ shortage and transplantation needs. However, building threedimensional (3D) vascularized organs remains the main technological barrier to be overcome. Organ printing, which is defined as computer-aided additive biofabrication of 3D cellular tissue constructs, has shed light on advancing this field into a new era. Organ printing takes advantage of rapid prototyping (RP) technology to print cells, biomaterials, and cell-laden biomaterials individually or in tandem, layer by layer, directly creating 3D tissue-like structures. Here, we overview RP-based bioprinting approaches and discuss the current challenges and trends towards fabricating living organs for transplant in the near future.},

A new helical phase (H*) with P622 symmetry was discovered in the self-assembly of poly(styrene)-b-poly(L-lactide) (PS-PLLA) BCPs*. Hexagonally packed, interdigitated PLLA helical microdomains in a PS matrix were directly visualized by electron tomography. The phase diagram of the PS-PLLA BCPs* was also established. Phase transitions from the H* phase to the stable cylinder and gyroid phases were found after long-time annealing, suggesting that the H* is a long-lived metastable phase. In contrast to racemic poly(styrene)-b-poly(D,L-lactide) BCPs, chiral interaction signiﬁcantly enhances the incompatibility between achiral PS and chiral PLLA blocks in the PS-PLLA BCPs* and can be estimated through the determination of the interaction parameter.},

	abstract = {DNA encounters topological problems in vivo because of its extended double-helical structure. As a consequence, the semiconservative mechanism of DNA replication leads to the formation of DNA braids or catenanes, which have to be removed for the completion of cell division. To get a better understanding of these structures, we have studied the elastic behavior of two braided nicked DNA molecules using a magnetic trap apparatus. The experimental data let us identify and characterize three regimes of braiding: a slightly twisted regime before the formation of the first crossing, followed by genuine braids which, at large braiding number, buckle to form plectonemes. Two different approaches support and quantify this characterization of the data. First, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of braided DNAs yield a full description of the molecules' behavior and their buckling transition. Second, modeling the braids as a twisted swing provides a good approximation of the elastic response of the molecules as they are intertwined. Comparisons of the experiments and the MC simulations with this analytical model allow for a measurement of the diameter of the braids and its dependence upon entropic and electrostatic repulsive interactions. The MC simulations allow for an estimate of the effective torsional constant of the braids (at a stretching force F = 2 pN): Cb ∼ 48 nm (as compared with C ∼100 nm for a single unnicked DNA). Finally, at low salt concentrations and for sufficiently large number of braids, the diameter of the braided molecules is observed to collapse to that of double-stranded DNA. We suggest that this collapse is due to the partial melting and fraying of the two nicked molecules and the subsequent right- or left-handed intertwining of the stretched single strands.},

In such a context, we have explored the possibility of using ultrathin twisted nanowires as torsion nanobalances to probe forces and torques at molecular level with high precision, a nanoscale system analogous to the Coulomb’s torsion balance electrometer. In order to achieve this goal, we performed a ﬁrst-principles investigation on the structural and electronic properties of twisted silicon nanowires, in their pristine and hydrogenated forms. The results indicated that wires with pentagonal and hexagonal cross-sections are the thinnest stable silicon nanostructures. Additionally, all wires followed a Hooke’s law behavior for small twisting deformations. Hydrogenation leads to spontaneous twisting, but with angular spring constants considerably smaller than the ones for the respective pristine forms. We observed considerable changes on the nanowire electronic properties upon twisting, which allows to envision the possibility of correlating the torsional angular deformation with the nanowire electronic transport. This could ultimately allow a direct access to measurements on interatomic forces at molecular level.},

	abstract = {Composite materials oﬀer numerous advantages over conventional engineering metals. Over the years, the use of composite materials has increased signiﬁcantly. Braiding is a promising and already very commonly used method to form continuous ﬁber reinforced composite materials. Braided structures are used in a broad range of applications including, but not limited to, medical, aerospace, and automotive. This paper reviews studies published in the ﬁeld of 2D braiding in order to outline advantages and disadvantages of the process, common preform impregnation techniques, and common stiﬀness critical applications. Furthermore, elastic property prediction models published in the ﬁeld are presented for the purpose of stiﬀness critical designs and applications.},

	abstract = {Wetting and capillary condensation are thermodynamic phenomena in which the special affinity of interfaces to a thermodynamic phase, relative to the stable bulk phase, leads to the stabilization of a wetting phase at the interfaces. Wetting and capillary condensation are here proposed as mechanisms that in membranes may serve to induce special lipid phases in between integral membrane proteins leading to long-range lipid-mediated joining forces acting between the proteins and hence providing a means of protein organization. The consequences of wetting in terms of protein aggregation and protein clustering are derived both within a simple phenomenological theory as well as within a concrete calculation on a microscopic model of lipid-protein interactions that accounts for the lipid bilayer phase equilibria and direct lipid-protein interactions governed by hydrophobic matching between the lipid bilayer hydrophobic thickness and the length of the hydrophobic membrane domain. The theoretical results are expected to be relevant for optimizing the experimental conditions required for forming protein aggregates and regular protein arrays in membranes.},

Here, surface functionalization of PMMA substrates via acid catalyzed hydrolysis and air plasma corona treatment were investigated as possible techniques to permanently bond PMMA microfluidic channels to PDMS surfaces. FTIR and water contact angle analysis of functionalized PMMA substrates showed that air plasma corona treatment was most effective in inducing PMMA hydrophilicity. Subsequent fluidic tests showed that air plasma modified and bonded PMMA multilayer devices could withstand fluid pressure at an operational flow rate of 9µL/min. The pneumatic actuation of the embedded PDMS membrane was observed through optical microscopy and an electrical resistance based technique. PDMS membrane actuation occurred at pneumatic pressures of as low as 10kPa and complete valving occurred at 14kPa for {\textasciitilde}100µm × 100µm channel cross-sections.},

We demonstrate that drops may move spontaneously towards the tapered end owing to the Laplace pressure gradient established along their length. The inﬂuence of gravity on this spontaneous motion is examined by studying drop motion along a tilted tube with its tapered end pointing upwards. Provided the tube taper varies, an equilibrium height may be achieved in which the capillary force is balanced by the drop’s weight. We deduce the family of tube shapes that support a stable equilibrium.},

	abstract = {Objects that float at the interface between a liquid and a gas interact because of interfacial deformation and the effect of gravity. We highlight the crucial role of buoyancy in this interaction, which, for small particles, prevails over the capillary suction that is often assumed to be the dominant effect. We emphasize this point using a simple classroom demonstration, and then derive the physical conditions leading to mutual attraction or repulsion. We also quantify the force of interaction in some particular instances and present a simple dynamical model of this interaction. The results obtained from this model are then validated by comparison to experimental results for the mutual attraction of two identical spherical particles. We conclude by looking at some of the applications of the effect that can be found in the natural and manmade worlds.},

	abstract = {Virus coat proteins of small isometric plant viruses readily assemble into symmetric, icosahedral cages encapsulating noncognate cargo, provided the cargo meets a minimal set of chemical and physical requirements. While this capability has been intensely explored for certain virus-enabled nanotechnologies, additional applications require lower symmetry than that of an icosahedron. Here, we show that the coat proteins of an icosahedral virus can eﬃciently assemble around metal nanorods into spherocylindrical closed shells with hexagonally close-packed bodies and icosahedral caps. Comparison of chiral angles and packing defects observed by in situ atomic force microscopy with those obtained from molecular dynamics models oﬀers insight into the mechanism of growth, and the inﬂuence of stresses associated with intrinsic curvature and assembly pathways.},

The system was composed of solid objects floating at the interface between perfluorodecalin and water and interacting by lateral capillary forces; patterning of the wettability of the surfaces of the objects directs these forces. Self-assembly results from minimization of the interfacial free energy of the liquid-liquid interface. Calculations suggest that this strategy for self-assembly can be applied to objects on a micrometer scale.},

	abstract = {3D mesostructures with a height of up to 1 mm and micrometer feature size are fabricated employing a writing speed of 1 cm s−1 via direct laser writing utilizing a novel functional photoresist based on the radical coupling reaction of thiols and alkynes. The refractive index of the resist—consisting of a tetrafunctional thiol, a tetrafunctional alkyne and a photoinitiator—is tailored to be compatible with the employed high numerical aperture (NA) objective lens, thus enabling a Dip-in configuration. Mesostructures are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, optical photography, and nondestructive 3D time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Woodpile photonic crystals are fabricated as benchmark structures in order to investigate the axial resolution. Verification of the chemical fabrication mechanism is achieved via transmission Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of fabricated cuboid structures by monitoring the decrease of corresponding thiol and alkyne absorption peaks. Postmodification reactions, namely the thiol-Michael addition and the copper-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition, are conducted employing residual thiols and alkynes throughout the cuboid structures. Successful dual and orthogonal modification throughout the structure and on the surface is achieved and verified utilizing transmission FTIR spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry.},

@article{nation_fabrication_nodate,
	title = {Fabrication of {Chip}-{Scale} {Radio} {Frequency} {Inductors}},
	abstract = {The purpose of this research was to learn the relationship between force and deformation in forming of micro-scale inductor coils. This was accomplished by applying large-deflection beam bending to the case of planar wire deformation and through experimental validation. Generating this knowledge is important because it establishes fabrication limits for wire-based chip-scale inductors. There are many potentially viable methods for fabricating planar inductor coils. Without an understanding of the relevant physics, it is impossible to know which of these techniques is most appropriate or even feasible. The analysis presented in this thesis directly led to the stencil-and-guide inductor fabrication concept, the details of which were specified using an analytic electrical model. The process utilizes a wire conductor, is compatible with any desired substrate, and features the ability to exactly control spiral properties. Multiple inductors were fabricated using this process. These inductors demonstrate performance specifications predicted by the model, including inductances ranging from 2 – 4 nH, quality factors in excess of 100, and self-resonant frequencies beyond 10 GHz. Furthermore, the area of the inductors is less than 1.5 mm2 and the entire device thickness is only 260 μm. The inductors are most readily applied to increasingly small communication devices, which require thin and efficient electrical components to boost the performance of the radio frequency transceiver. Accordingly, these inductors offer the potential for substantial improvement in signal quality and reception.},

	abstract = {Despite many advances, most three-dimensional (3D) printers today remain in the realm of rapid prototyping, rarely being used for manufacturing. Currently, the greatest challenges to advancing 3D printing technology are small build volumes, long print times, and limited material properties. In this article, we present rapid liquid printing (RLP) as a solution to these challenges. RLP is an experimental process that uses a tank of granular gel as a reusable support medium to greatly increase the speed, size, and material properties in 3D printing. The RLP machine can freely print in any direction, rather than layer by layer, depositing liquid material into the granular gel to form 3D structures. The RLP deposition system can use any one- or two-part material that is photo or chemically cured, expanding the range of possible materials to include high-quality industrial-grade rubbers, foams, and plastics, among many others. It is platform independent and can be implemented on any computer numerically controlled machine, robotic arm, or similar fabrication machine. In our research, we demonstrate the possible range of scales, printing both small- and large-scale objects ranging from inches to many feet. In addition to scale, RLP is fast, capable of printing a complex object in seconds to minutes rather than hours or days. In this article, we outline the three major components in the system: the control platform, deposition system, and granular gel. In addition, we explain our materials research and outline the primary steps of operation. Lastly, we present our results by comparing prints from an RLP machine with a stereolithography printer. With a combination of speed, scale, and a wide range of materials, RLP is an ideal platform for researchers, designers, and manufacturers to quickly print large-scale products with high-quality, industrial-grade materials.},

Capillary-force as a significant driving force of self-assembly has become a versatile and scalable approach to build complex geometries at the micro/nanoscales. In order to take full advantage of capillary-force to fabricate specific micro/nanoscales devices, we have done a thorough research on the mechanism of capillary-force self-assembly and analyzed the impact factors of micro/nanostructures suffered during the self-assembly process. In the aspect of application, we classified the main assembly methods, micro/nanostructures which can be got and their potential applications. Finally, we indicated that capillary-force self-assembly would have broad utilization in micro/nanofabrication due to its tunability and simplicity. Meanwhile, we put forward some issues that need to be solved in the further research.},

	abstract = {We have demonstrated the fluidic self-assembly of micromachined silicon parts onto silicon and quartz substrates in a preconfigured pattern with submicrometer positioning precision. Self-assembly is accomplished using photolithographically defined part and substrate binding sites that are complementary shapes of hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers. The patterned substrate is passed through a film of hydrophobic adhesive on water, causing the adhesive to selectively coat the binding sites. Next, the microscopic parts, fabricated from silicon-on-insulator wafers and ranging in size from 150/spl times/150/spl times/15 /spl mu/m/sup 3/ to 400/spl times/400/spl times/50 /spl mu/m/sup 3/, are directed toward the substrate surface under water using a pipette. Once the hydrophobic pattern on a part comes into contact with an adhesive-coated substrate binding site, shape matching occurs spontaneously due to interfacial free energy minimization. In water, capillary forces of the adhesive hold the parts in place with an alignment precision of less than 0.2 /spl mu/m. Permanent bonding of the parts onto quartz and silicon is accomplished by activating the adhesive with heat or ultraviolet light. The resulting rotational misalignment is within /spl sim/0.3/spl deg/. Using square sites, 98-part arrays have been assembled in less than 1 min with 100\% yield. The general microassembly approach described here may be applied to parts ranging in size from the nano- to milliscale, and part and substrate materials including semiconductors, glass, plastics, and metals.},

	abstract = {The hierarchical structures are the derivation of various functionalities in the natural world and have inspired broad practical applications in chemical systhesis and biological manipulation. However, traditional top-down fabrication approaches suﬀered from low complexity. We propose a laser printing capillary-assisted self-assembly (LPCS) strategy for fabricating regular periodic structures. Microscale pillars are ﬁrst produced by the localized femtosecond laser polymerization and are subsequently self-assembled into periodic hierarchical architectures with the assistance of controlled capillary force. Moreover, based on anisotropic assemblies of micropillars, the LPCS method is further developed for the preparation of more complicated and advanced functional microstructures. Pillars cross section, height, and spatial arrangement can be tuned to guide capillary force, and diverse assemblies with diﬀerent conﬁgurations are thus achieved. Finally, we developed a strategy for growing micro/ nanoparticles in designed spatial locations through solution-evaporation self-assembly induced by morphology. Due to the high ﬂexibility of LPCS method, the special arrangements, sizes, and distribution density of the micro/nanoparticles can be controlled readily. Our method will be employed not only to fabricate anisotropic hierarchical structures but also to design and manufacture organic/inorganic microparticles.},

Vast literature and experimental data support such claim. Still, the technique needs to overcome some important limitations in order to fully express its potential and earn wide industrial recognition. In this paper, we review and illustrate what are in our opinion the challenges ahead for making part-to-substrate capillary self-assembly reliable and seriously competitive with long-established assembly techniques. After setting self-assembly methods in the context of microsystem assembly and integration technologies, we focus on the standard embodiment of capillary self-assembly, and we describe in details the main, often novel technological steps required for its effective and reproducible performance. This preludes to an outline of what are presently, in our view, the major failure modes affecting the overall yield of the capillary self-assembly technique. Consequently, we propose solutions to face and overcome these challenges, which need to be met to foster the success of this technique.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a method to create highdensity DNA coatings on colloidal particles that can be used for DNA-mediated self-assembly of single- and multiplecomponent colloidal crystals. First, we modify an amphiphilic diblock copolymer consisting of a hydrophobic polystyrene (PS) block and a hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) block with azide functional groups at the end (poly(ethylene oxide)-N3). Then, we introduce the diblock copolymers into an aqueous suspension of colloidal polymer particles swollen with a solvent. The hydrophobic PS anchoring block is incorporated into the swollen polymer spheres and physically trapped when the solvent is removed, resulting in a dense PEO polymer brush with azide functional end groups. Finally, singlestranded DNA strands with sticky ends are attached to the azide groups using strain-promoted azide−alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC, a copper-free click chemistry). This procedure results in a high areal coverage of up to 225 000 DNA strands on 1-μmdiameter particles. The ssDNA-coated particles with sticky ends can readily form either face-centered-cubic (fcc) or cesium chloride (CsCl) crystal structures when annealed just below the melting temperature of the DNA-coated particles.},

	abstract = {Optical activity is an effect of prominent importance in stereochemistry, analytical chemistry, metamaterials, spin photonics, and astrobiology, but is naturally minuscule. Metallic nanostructures are commonly exploited as basic elements for artificially producing large optical activity by virtue of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on the nanostructures. However, their intrinsic high ohmic loss amplified by the SPR results in low energy efficiency and large photothermal heat generation, severely limiting their performance and practical utility. Giant optical activity by inducing magnetic resonance in an all-dielectric spiral nanoflower (spiral-flower-shaped nanostructure) is demonstrated here. Specifically, a large circular-intensity difference of ≈35\% is theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated by optimizing the magnetic quadrupole contribution of the nanoflower to scattered light. The nanoflower overcomes the bottleneck of the traditional metallic platforms and enables the development of diverse chiroptical devices and applications.},

The capability and feasibility of this approach have been demonstrated with the organization of polymer latex or silica beads into homo-aggregates, including circular rings; polygonal and polyhedral clusters; and linear, zigzag, and spiral chains. It was also possible to generate hetero-aggregates in the configuration of HF and H2O molecules that contained spherical colloids of different sizes, compositions, densities, functions, or a combination of these features. These uniform, well-defined aggregates of spherical colloids are ideal model systems to investigate the aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and optical properties of colloidal particles characterized by non-spherical shapes and/or complex topologies. They can also serve as a new class of building blocks to generate hierarchically self-assembled structures that are expected to exhibit interesting features valuable to areas ranging from condensed matter physics to photonics.},

The trajectories and layering during the direct writing process often result in roughness in the range of the writing increment, which has adverse effects for optical applications. Instead of increasing overlap between adjacent voxels, roughness in the range of 100 nm can be smoothed out by post-processing. For this a method known as TASTE was developed, which allows polishing of surfaces without changing the structural details or the overall shape. It works particularly well with thermoplastic polymers and enables sub-10 nm roughness. The optical quality was confirmed for an array with several 100 microlenses.},

CAH is affected by chemistry and topography defects at the molecular and higher levels, thus most surfaces exhibit significant CAH. Preparative methods for stable coatings on smooth substrates with negligible CAH ({\textless}2°) for a broad range of liquids have not been reported. In this work, we describe a simple and rapid procedure to prepare omniphobic surfaces that are stable under pressure and durable at elevated temperatures. Consistent with theory, they exhibit sliding angles that decrease with liquid surface tension. Slippery omniphobic covalently attached liquid (SOCAL) surfaces are obtained through acid-catalyzed graft polycondensation of dimethyldimethoxysilane. The smooth, stable, and temperature-resistant coatings show extremely low CAH (≤1°) and low sliding angles for liquids that span surface tensions from 78.2 to 18.4 mN m−1.},

Among commonly used dyes for amino group quantiﬁcation, Orange II and Coomassie Brillant Blue (CBB) were selected to quantify the extent of amine grafting resulting from these derivatization procedures. Rapid and convenient colorimetric assays were compared to surface atomic compositions obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Orange II was found to be the most appropriate dye for quantifying primary amine groups in a reliable and speciﬁc way. Due to its unique negative charge and low steric hindrance compared to CBB, the Orange II dye was very sensitive and provided reliable quantiﬁcation over a wide range of amino group surface densities (ca. 5 to at least 200 pmol/mm2). In order to further validate the use of the Orange II dye for amino group quantiﬁcation, a heterobifunctional linker reacting with amino groups was then grafted on modiﬁed PET surfaces. Interestingly, the good correlation between the densities of adsorbed Orange II and covalently grafted linkers suggests that the Orange II method is a relevant, reliable, easy, and inexpensive method to predict the amount of amino groups available for subsequent functionalization of polymer surfaces.},

However, the insuﬃcient reliability of techniques for the meniscus formation still restricts its practical use. We report on a noncontact, programmable method to produce a femtoliter liquid meniscus that is utilized for parallel threedimensional (3D) nanoprinting. The method based on electrohydrodynamic dispensing enables one to create an ink meniscus at a pipet−substrate gap without physical contact and positional feedback. By guiding the meniscus under rapid evaporation of solvent in air, we successfully fabricate freestanding polymer 3D nanostructures. After a quantitative characterization of the experimental conditions, we show that we can use a multibarrel pipet to achieve parallel fabrication process of clustered nanowires with precise placement. We expect this technique to advance productivity in nanoscale 3D printing.},

The simplicity and scalability of this process, as well as the hierarchical organization of CNWs, provides a potential alternative to the use of carbon nanotubes and graphene for applications in microsystems and high surface area materials. The CNWs are highly branched at the nanoscale, and novel hierarchical microstructures with CNWs connected to a solid amorphous core are made by controlling the plasma treatment time. By multilayer processing we demonstrate deterministic joining of CNW micropillars into 3D sensing networks. Finally we show that these networks can be chemically functionalized and used for measurement of DNA binding with increased sensitivity.},

	abstract = {The properties of carbon nanotube (CNT) networks and analogous materials comprising ﬁlamentary nanostructures are governed by the intrinsic ﬁlament properties and their hierarchical organization and interconnection. As a result, direct knowledge of the collective dynamics of CNT synthesis and self-organization is essential to engineering improved CNT materials for applications such as membranes and thermal interfaces. Here, we use real-time environmental transmission electron microscopy (E-TEM) to observe nucleation and self-organization of CNTs into vertically aligned forests. Upon introduction of the carbon source, we observe a large scatter in the onset of nucleation of individual CNTs and the ensuing growth rates. Experiments performed at diﬀerent temperatures and catalyst particle densities show the critical role of CNT density on the dynamics of self-organization; low-density CNT nucleation results in the CNTs becoming pinned to the substrate and forming random networks, whereas higher density CNT nucleation results in self-organization of the CNTs into bundles that are oriented perpendicular to the substrate. We also ﬁnd that mechanical coupling between growing CNTs alters their growth trajectory and shape, causing signiﬁcant deformations, buckling, and defects in the CNT walls. Therefore, it appears that CNT−CNT coupling not only is critical for self-organization but also directly inﬂuences CNT quality and likely the resulting properties of the forest. Our ﬁndings show that control of the time-distributed kinetics of CNT nucleation and bundle formation are critical to manufacturing well-organized CNT assemblies and that E-TEM can be a powerful tool to investigate the mesoscale dynamics of CNT networks.},

The addition of diagonal cuts to an equivalent closed cell permits the cell to collapse reversibly without incurring significant tensile strains in its panels. Using finite-element modeling and experiments we show how the mechanical behavior of the cell is governed by the coupled rigidity of the panels and hinges and we design cells to achieve reversible force response ranging from smooth monostability to sharp bi-stability. We then demonstrate the cell-based construction of laminates with multistable behavior and a rotary-linear boom actuator, as well as self-deploying cells with shape memory alloy hinges. Advanced digital fabrication methods can enable the realization of this and other so-called flexigami designs that derive their overall mechanics from fold and panel elasticity, for applications including deployable structures, soft robotics and medical devices.},

	abstract = {Large-scale, deterministic assembly of nanowires and nanotubes with rationally controlled geometries could expand the potential applications of one-dimensional nanomaterials in bottom-up integrated nanodevice arrays and circuits. Control of the positions of straight nanowires and nanotubes has been achieved using several assembly methods, although simultaneous control of position and geometry has not been realized. Here, we demonstrate a new concept combining simultaneous assembly and guided shaping to achieve large-scale, high-precision shape controlled deterministic assembly of nanowires. We lithographically pattern U-shaped trenches and then shear transfer nanowires to the patterned substrate wafers, where the trenches serve to deﬁne the positions and shapes of transferred nanowires. Studies using semicircular trenches deﬁned by electron-beam lithography yielded U-shaped nanowires with radii of curvature deﬁned by inner surface of the trenches. Wafer-scale deterministic assembly produced U-shaped nanowires for {\textgreater}430 000 sites with a yield of ∼90\%. In addition, mechanistic studies and simulations demonstrate that shaping results in primarily elastic deformation of the nanowires and show clearly the diameter-dependent limits achievable for accessible forces. Last, this approach was used to assemble U-shaped three-dimensional nanowire ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor bioprobe arrays containing 200 individually addressable nanodevices. By combining the strengths of wafer-scale top-down fabrication with diverse and tunable properties of one-dimensional building blocks in novel structural conﬁgurations, shape-controlled deterministic nanowire assembly is expected to enable new applications in many areas including nanobioelectronics and nanophotonics.},

	abstract = {For many natural and synthetic self-assembled materials, adaptive behavior is central to their function, yet the design of such systems has mainly focused on the static form rather than the dynamic potential of the ﬁnal structure. Here we show that, following the initial evaporation-induced assembly of micropillars determined by the balance between capillarity and elasticity, the stability and reversibility of the produced clusters are highly sensitive to the adhesion between the pillars, as determined by their surface chemistry and further regulated by added solvents. When the native surface of the epoxy pillars is masked by a thin gold layer and modiﬁed with monolayers terminated with various chemical functional groups, the resulting eﬀect is a graded inﬂuence on the stability of cluster formation, ranging from fully disassembled clusters to an entire array of stable clusters. The observed assembly stabilization eﬀect parallels the order of the strengths of the chemical bonds expected to form by the respective monolayer end groups: NH2 ≈ OH {\textless} COOH {\textless} SH. For each functional group, the stability of the clusters can be further modiﬁed by varying the carbon chain length of the monolayer molecules and by introducing solvents into the clustered samples, allowing even ﬁner tuning as well as temporal control of disassembly. Using these features together with microcontact printing, we demonstrate straightforward patterning of the microstructured surfaces with clusters that can be erased and regenerated at will by the addition of appropriate solvents. Subtle modiﬁcations to surface and solvent chemistry provide a simple way to tune the balance between adhesion and elasticity in real time, enabling structures to be designed for dynamic, responsive behavior.},

	abstract = {Emerging research toward next-generation ﬂexible and wearable electronics has stimulated the eﬀorts to build highly wearable, durable, and deformable energy devices with excellent electrochemical performances. Here, we develop a high-performance, waterproof, tailorable, and stretchable yarn zinc ion battery (ZIB) using double-helix yarn electrodes and a cross-linked polyacrylamide (PAM) electrolyte. Due to the high ionic conductivity of the PAM electrolyte and helix structured electrodes, the yarn ZIB delivers a high speciﬁc capacity and volumetric energy density (302.1 mAh g−1 and 53.8 mWh cm−3, respectively) as well as excellent cycling stability (98.5\% capacity retention after 500 cycles). More importantly, the quasi-solid-state yarn ZIB also demonstrates superior knittability, good stretchability (up to 300\% strain), and superior waterproof capability (high capacity retention of 96.5\% after 12 h underwater operation). In addition, the long yarn ZIB can be tailored into short ones, and each part still functions well. Owing to its weavable and tailorable nature, a 1.1 m long yarn ZIB was cut into eight parts and woven into a textile that was used to power a long ﬂexible belt embedded with 100 LEDs and a 100 cm2 ﬂexible electroluminescent panel.},

	abstract = {Direct laser writing has become a versatile and routine tool for the mask-free fabrication of polymer structures with lateral linewidths down to less than 100 nm. In contrast to its planar counterpart, electron-beam lithography, direct laser writing also allows for the making of three-dimensional structures. However, its spatial resolution has been restricted by diffraction. Clearly, linewidths and resolutions on the scale of few tens of nanometers and below are highly desirable for various applications in nanotechnology. In visible-light far-field fluorescence microscopy, the concept of stimulated emission depletion (STED) introduced in 1994 has led to spectacular record resolutions down to 5.6 nm in 2009. This review addresses approaches aiming at translating this success in optical microscopy to optical lithography. After explaining basic principles and limitations, possible depletion mechanisms and recent lithography experiments by various groups are summarized. Today, Abbe's diffraction barrier as well as the generalized two-photon Sparrow criterion have been broken in far-field optical lithography. For further future progress in resolution, the development of novel tailored photoresists in combination with attractive laser sources is of utmost importance.},

	abstract = {Thin films of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) are commonly used to promote adhesion between silica substrates and organic or metallic materials with applications ranging from advanced composites to biomolecular lab-on-a-chip. Unfortunately, there is confusion as to which reaction conditions will result in consistently aminated surfaces. A wide range of conflicting experimental methods are used with researchers often assuming the creation of smooth self-assembled monolayers. A range of film morphologies based on the film deposition conditions are presented here to establish an optimized method of APTES film formation. The effect of reaction temperature, solution concentration, and reaction time on the structure and morphology was studied for the system of APTES on silica. Three basic morphologies were observed:  smooth thin film, smooth thick film, and roughened thick film.},

	abstract = {Self-assembling protein layers provide a “bottom-up” approach for precisely organizing functional elements at the nanoscale over a large solid surface area. The design of protein sheets with architecture and physical properties suitable for nanotechnological applications may be greatly facilitated by a thorough understanding of the principles that underlie their self-assembly and disassembly. In a previous study, the hexagonal lattice formed by the capsid protein (CA) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was self-assembled as a monomolecular layer directly onto a solid substrate, and its mechanical properties and dynamics at equilibrium were analyzed by atomic force microscopy. Here, we use atomic force microscopy to analyze the kinetics of self-assembly of the planar CA lattice on a substrate and of its disassembly, either spontaneous or induced by materials fatigue. Both self-assembly and disassembly of the CA layer are cooperative reactions that proceed until a phase equilibrium is reached. Self-assembly requires a critical protein concentration and is initiated by formation of nucleation points on the substrate, followed by lattice growth and eventual merging of CA patches into a continuous monolayer. Disassembly of the CA layer showed hysteresis and appears to proceed only after large enough defects (nucleation points) are formed in the lattice, whose number is largely increased by inducing materials fatigue that depends on mechanical load and its frequency. Implications of the kinetic results obtained for a better understanding of self-assembly and disassembly of the HIV capsid and protein-based two-dimensional nanomaterials and the design of anti-HIV drugs targeting (dis)assembly and biocompatible nanocoatings are discussed.},

Atomic force microscopy was used to determine the mechanical properties of individual, structurally isolated silicon carbide (SiC) nanorods (NRs) and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) that were pinned at one end to molybdenum disulfide surfaces. The bending force was measured versus displacement along the unpinned lengths. The MWNTs were about two times as stiff as the SiC NRs. Continued bending of the SiC NRs ultimately led to fracture, whereas the MWNTs exhibited an interesting elastic buckling process. The strengths of the SiC NRs were substantially greater than those found previously for larger SiC structures, and they approach theoretical values. Because of buckling, the ultimate strengths of the stiffer MWNTs were less than those of the SiC NRs, although the MWNTs represent a uniquely tough, energy-absorbing material.},

            The electronic devices that play a vital role in our daily life are primarily based on silicon and are thus rigid, opaque, and relatively heavy. However, new electronics relying on polymer semiconductors are opening up new application spaces like stretchable and self-healing sensors and devices, and these can facilitate the integration of such devices into our homes, our clothing, and even our bodies. While there has been tremendous interest in such technologies, the widespread adoption of these organic electronics requires low-cost manufacturing techniques. Fortunately, the realization of organic electronics can take inspiration from a technology developed since the beginning of the Common Era: printing. This review addresses the critical issues and considerations in the printing methods for organic electronics, outlines the fundamental fluid mechanics, polymer physics, and deposition parameters involved in the fabrication process, and provides future research directions for the next generation of printed polymer electronics.},

We assemble and measure the optical properties of three cluster types: Fano-resonant heptamers, linear chains, and rings of nanoparticles. The yield of heptamer clusters is measured to be over 30\%. The assembly of plasmonic nanoclusters on an elastomer paves the way for new classes of plasmonic nanocircuits and colloidal metamaterials that can be transfer-printed onto various substrate media.},

The as-forwardly aligned p/MQW/n InGaN nanorod LEDs by a pulsed DC dielectrophoresis (DEP) assembly process improve the electroluminescence (EL) intensities by 1.8 times compared to the conventional AC DEP assembly process under DC electric ﬁeld operation and exhibit an enhanced applied current and EL brightness in the current−voltage and EL intensity−voltage curves, which can be directly used as the fundamental data to construct DC-operated nanorod LED devices, such as LED areal surface lightings, scalable lightings (micrometers to inches) and formable surface lightings. The enhancement in the applied current, the improved EL intensity, and the increased number of forwardly aligned p/MQW/n InGaN nanorods in panchromatic cathodoluminescence images conﬁrm the considerable enhancement of forwardly aligned one-dimensional nanorod LEDs between two opposite electrodes using DC oﬀset-AC or a pulsed DC electric ﬁeld DEP assembly process. These DC oﬀset-AC or pulsed DC electric ﬁeld DEP assembly processes suggest that designing for these types of interactions could yield new ways to control the orientation of asymmetric p/MQW/n InGaN diode-type LED nanorods with a relatively low aspect ratio.},

            Morphology control of solution coated solar cell materials presents a key challenge limiting their device performance and commercial viability. Here we present a new concept for controlling phase separation during solution printing using an all-polymer bulk heterojunction solar cell as a model system. The key aspect of our method lies in the design of fluid flow using a microstructured printing blade, on the basis of the hypothesis of flow-induced polymer crystallization. Our flow design resulted in a ∼90\% increase in the donor thin film crystallinity and reduced microphase separated donor and acceptor domain sizes. The improved morphology enhanced all metrics of solar cell device performance across various printing conditions, specifically leading to higher short-circuit current, fill factor, open circuit voltage and significantly reduced device-to-device variation. We expect our design concept to have broad applications beyond all-polymer solar cells because of its simplicity and versatility.},

In this Review, we critically evaluate both how recent advances in materials fabrication have expanded the frontiers of microfluidic platforms and how the improved microfluidic capabilities are, in turn, furthering materials design. We discuss how various inorganic and organic materials enable the fabrication of systems with advanced mechanical, optical, chemical, electrical and biointerfacial properties — in particular, when these materials are combined into new hybrids and modular configurations. The increasing sophistication of microfluidic techniques has also expanded the range of resources available for the fabrication of new materials, including particles and fibres with specific functionalities, 3D (bio)printed composites and organoids.

            Conventional understanding has it that a liquid deposited on a surface tends to move along directions that reduce surface energy, which is mainly dictated by surface properties rather than liquid properties, such as surface tension. Achieving well-controlled directional steering remains challenging because the liquid-solid interaction mainly occurs in the two-dimensional (2D) domain. We show that the spreading direction of liquids with different surface tensions can be tailored by designing 3D capillary ratchets that create an asymmetric and 3D spreading profile both in and out of the surface plane. Such directional steering is also accompanied by self-propulsion and high flow velocity, all of which are preferred in liquid transport.},

            Adjusting the floating states when objects float on water shows great potential for assembly, mineral flotation, nanostructured construction, and floating robot design, but the real-time regulation of floating states is challenging. Inspired by the different floating states of a falling fruit, we propose a facile strategy to transform the object between different floating states based on a three-segment three-phase contact line evolution. In addition, the potential of floating state transformation in solar-powered water evaporation, interface catalysis, and drug delivery is demonstrated. These findings provide insights into floating regulation and show great potential for floating-related applications.
          , 
            Objects floating on water are ubiquitous in nature and daily life. The floating states of objects are significant for a wide range of fields, including assembly, mineral flotation, nanostructured construction, and floating robot design. Generally, an object exhibits a unique and fixed floating state. The real-time regulation of floating states by a simple method is attractive but challenging. Based on in-depth analysis of the different floating states of fruits falling on water, we reveal that the mutable floating states are caused by the three-segment three-phase contact line dynamics. Accordingly, we propose a “buoyancy hysteresis loop” for the transformation of objects between different floating states. More importantly, we demonstrate the potential applications of floating state transformation in solar-powered water evaporation and interface catalysis. The evaporation and catalytic efficiencies can be changed several times by switching the floating state. These findings deepen the understanding of the interfacial effect to the floating of micro-objects and show great potential for floating-related fields.},

We can transport, split, release, and rotate the droplets using the robot. This robot is universally applicable for manipulation of various fluids in rough environments.

            Droplet impact on solid surfaces is essential for natural and industrial processes. Particularly, controlling the instability after droplet impact, and avoiding the satellite drops generation, have aroused great interest for its significance in inkjet printing, pesticide spraying, and hydroelectric power collection. Herein, we found that breaking the symmetry of the droplet impact dynamics using patterned-wettability surfaces can suppress the Plateau–Rayleigh instability during the droplet rebounding and improve the energy collection efficiency. Systematic experimental investigation, together with mechanical modeling and numerical simulation, revealed that the asymmetric wettability patterns can regulate the internal liquid flow and reduce the vertical velocity gradient inside the droplet, thus suppressing the instability during droplet rebounding and eliminating the satellite drops. Accordingly, the droplet energy utilization was promoted, as demonstrated by the improved hydroelectric power generation efficiency by 36.5\%. These findings deepen the understanding of the wettability-induced asymmetrical droplet dynamics during the liquid–solid interactions, and facilitate related applications such as hydroelectric power generation and materials transportation.},

Here we show that the translational motion of an impacting droplet can be converted to gyration, with a maximum rotational speed exceeding 7300 revolutions per minute, through heterogeneous surface wettability regulation. The gyration behavior is enabled by the synergetic effect of the asymmetric pinning forces originated from surface heterogeneity and the excess surface energy of the spreading droplet after impact.

            Asymmetric mechanical transducers have important applications in energy harvesting, signal transmission, and micro-mechanics. To achieve asymmetric transformation of mechanical motion or energy, active robotic metamaterials, as well as materials with asymmetric microstructures or internal orientation, are usually employed. However, these strategies usually require continuous energy supplement and laborious fabrication, and limited transformation modes are achieved. Herein, utilizing wettability patterned surfaces for precise control of the droplet contact line and inner flow, we demonstrate a droplet-based mechanical transducer system, and achieve multimodal responses to specific vibrations. By virtue of the synergistic effect of surface tension and solid-liquid adhesion on the liquid dynamics, the droplet on the patterned substrate can exhibit symmetric/asymmetric vibration transformation when the substrate vibrates horizontally. Based on this, we construct arrayed patterns with distinct arrangements on the substrate, and employ the swarm effect of the arrayed droplets to achieve three-dimensional and multimodal actuation of the target plate under a fixed input vibration. Further, we demonstrate the utilization of the mechanical transducers for vibration management, object transport, and laser modulation. These findings provide a simple yet efficient strategy to realize a multimodal mechanical transducer, which shows significant potential for aseismic design, optical molding, as well as micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).},

            For a drop on a very hot solid surface, a vapor film will form beneath the drop, which has been discovered by Leidenfrost in 1756. The vapor escaping from the Leidenfrost film causes uncontrollable flows, and actuates the drop to move around. Recently, although numerous strategies have been used to regulate the Leidenfrost vapor, the understanding of surface chemistry for modulating the phase-change vapor dynamics remains incomplete. Here, we report how to rectify vapor by “cutting” the Leidenfrost film using chemically heterogeneous surfaces. We demonstrate that the segmented film cut by a Z-shaped pattern can spin a drop, since the superhydrophilic region directly contacts the drop and vaporizes the water, while a vapor film is formed on the superhydrophobic surrounding to jet vapor and reduce heat transfer. Furthermore, we reveal the general principle between the pattern symmetry design and the drop dynamics. This finding provides new insights into the Leidenfrost dynamics modulation, and opens a promising avenue for vapor-driven miniature devices.},

Compared with homogeneous surfaces, nonuniformity in wettability endows a heterogeneous surface with a more remarkable capability for manipulation of the solid–liquid–gas interactions, which contributes to the progress and innovation in various applications, such as device fabrication, biological screening, and sample analysis. Recently, the development in microfabrication techniques has greatly promoted the versatility and diversity in the design and fabrication of substrates with high‐precision and high‐resolution heterogeneous wettability. In this review, the general principle of liquid manipulation using heterogeneous wettability surfaces is discussed.

Typical applications focused on optic/electronic device fabrication and biosensing/detection are summarized.

              In developing biomedical devices that need to interface with biological tissues, there is the challenge of bridging between devices, which are usually hard and operate through electrical signals, and tissues, which are soft and primarily use ion conduction. Shi
              et al
              . developed a “living biointerface” composed of an electronics layer and a
              Staphylococcus epidermidis
              –laden hydrogel composite (see the Perspective by Olofsson). This composite layer facilitates multimodal signal transduction at the microbial-mammalian interface. Furthermore, it ensures high viability of the bacteria and enables freeze storage of the device. Using their device, the authors wirelessly recorded electrical signals from the skin surface of mice and improved disease treatment in a mouse model of psoriasis. —Marc S. Lavine},

Yet, mechanical pick-and-place technologies cannot manipulate smaller objects whose surface forces dominate over gravity, and emerging microtransfer printing methods require multidirectional motion, heating, and/or chemical bonding to switch adhesion. We introduce soft nanocomposite electroadhesives (SNEs), comprising sparse forests of dielectric-coated carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which have electrostatically switchable dry adhesion. SNEs exhibit 40-fold lower nominal dry adhesion than typical solids, yet their adhesion is increased {\textgreater}100-fold by applying 30 V to the CNTs. We characterize the scaling of adhesion with surface morphology, dielectric thickness, and applied voltage and demonstrate digital transfer printing of films of Ag nanowires, polymer and metal microparticles, and unpackaged light-emitting diodes.},

            Reconfigurable modular microfluidics presents an opportunity for flexibly constructing prototypes of advanced microfluidic systems. Nevertheless, the strategy of directly integrating modules cannot easily fulfill the requirements of common applications, e.g., the incorporation of materials with biochemical compatibility and optical transparency and the execution of small batch production of disposable chips for laboratory trials and initial tests. Here, we propose a manufacturing scheme inspired by the movable type printing technique to realize 3D free-assembly modular microfluidics. Double-layer 3D microfluidic structures can be produced by replicating the assembled molds. A library of modularized molds is presented for flow control, droplet generation and manipulation and cell trapping and coculture. In addition, a variety of modularized attachments, including valves, light sources and microscopic cameras, have been developed with the capability to be mounted onto chips on demand. Microfluidic systems, including those for concentration gradient generation, droplet-based microfluidics, cell trapping and drug screening, are demonstrated. This scheme enables rapid prototyping of microfluidic systems and construction of on-chip research platforms, with the intent of achieving high efficiency of proof-of-concept tests and small batch manufacturing.},

            After half a billion years of evolution, arthropods have developed sophisticated compound eyes with extraordinary visual capabilities that have inspired the development of artificial compound eyes. However, the limited 2D nature of most traditional fabrication techniques makes it challenging to directly replicate these natural systems. Here, we present a biomimetic apposition compound eye fabricated using a microfluidic-assisted 3D-printing technique. Each microlens is connected to the bottom planar surface of the eye via intracorporal, zero-crosstalk refractive-index-matched waveguides to mimic the rhabdoms of a natural eye. Full-colour wide-angle panoramic views and position tracking of a point source are realized by placing the fabricated eye directly on top of a commercial imaging sensor. As a biomimetic analogue to naturally occurring compound eyes, the eye’s full-colour 3D to 2D mapping capability has the potential to enable a wide variety of applications from improving endoscopic imaging to enhancing machine vision for facilitating human–robot interactions.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews authors’ laboratory’s work on the development of nitride-based blue–green and ultraviolet microscale LED devices with particular classes of imaging and spectroscopic applications in cellular level biology. Starting from neuroscience, we illustrate the utility of blue–green micro-LEDs for voltage-sensitive dye imaging of individual neural cells, as well as their ultraviolet counterparts for photostimulation of neurons. Arrays of micro-LEDs are also shown to be useful in projecting spatiotemporal patterns of photoexcitation to study the visual system development in living animals. As another illustration of the utility of the emerging nitride microdevice technology, we demonstrate the application of UV micro-LED arrays in bio-sensing technology as the core of a real-time ﬂuorescence spectroscopy biowarning system.},

	abstract = {Viruses are ubiquitous biological entities that have been increasingly adopted for positive applications. Fundamental knowledge of virus structure and stabilities is vital for understanding virus infection and development of novel virus-based materials. During an infectious cycle, the viral capsid has to pass through numerous cellular barriers and simultaneously encounter forces. Thus, it is important to understand how virus capsids react to mechanical perturbations.    This dissertation work takes on the structure and mechanochemistry of icosahedral viruses and virus shells. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and nano-indentation are the primary methods utilized in this study because they provide good spatial and force resolution for understanding the nano-mechanical events. The types of strain that were examined include compression, flattening, shrinkage, collapse, etc.    Firstly, we studied the adsorption of viruses on AFM substrates to understand the impact of adhesive interactions. We have discovered an orientation bias and a surface-induced deformation upon adsorption. A physical model was also proposed to describe the mechanochemical properties of the capsid without performing indentation. Secondly, an AFM nano-indentation assay in presence of macromolecules was carried out to mimic crowding effect. A small external osmotic pressure was found to stiffen the capsid, while higher osmotic pressure can soften the capsid. Thirdly, the resilience of virus capsids was studied by dehydration and nano-indentation. We observed a remarkable recovery of capsid after a dehydration/rehydration cycle. Plastic deformation was observed for BMV after deep indentation. Fourthly, the capsomeric structure of virus-like particles (VLPs) was determined for the first time for both spherical and spherocylindrical particles. Structural analyses were performed to understand the origin of defects as well. Lastly, the surface adsorption and elasticity was examined for a gene therapy vector. Connections were found between mechanochemical properties and encapsulated cargo. A statistical model was put forward for prediction of cargo type.},
