Capillary Machines: controlled assembly driven by precise engineering of capillary forces.

The precise assembly of objects at the micro-/nano-scales requires well-controlled forces that are sufficient to move the objects around, yet gentle enough to avoid any plastic deformations. Cheng and his colleagues at Harvard created "capillary machines", a class of simple plastic devices that move vertically across the air-water interface when operated, to assemble micro- and nanometer-scaled systems. Complex topologies, such as hair-braids which were otherwise not possible to make at such small length scales, have been demonstrated with this method (see our paper in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05234-7) and video below).
​
At CAS, we're pushing the boundaries of capillary machines towards much more complex systems. We aim to achieve high throughput, arbitrary topologies, and material selectivity during assembly.
