Li, Zhe

Master, 2023

Li, Zhe is a graduate student in Dalian university, majoring in mechanical engineering. In July 2024, he joined the group as a joint student. Having graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, he is thrilled to continue his academic journey here. He is particularly fascinated by the potential applications of repulsive capillary forces in micro- and nano-fabrication processes. His research interest focuses on using repulsive capillary force for assembly, exploring how these unique interactions can be harnessed to create novel materials and structures.
