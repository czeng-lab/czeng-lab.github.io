The Zeng Lab just opened its doors in April 2024 in the [Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics (SINANO)](https://www.sinano.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences. 

Cheng Zeng obtained his Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Indiana University Bloomington in 2017, where he studied the assembly and interactions in virus-like particles in Bogdan Dragnea's lab. Later, he completed a postdoc with Vinny Manoharan at Harvard, working on using capillary forces to braid fibers and manipulate microparticles. 

In general, Cheng is interested in (1) self-assembly and directed-assembly — from packing coat proteins onto a curved template to packing filaments into a bundle; (2) interfaces - capillarity, wettability, and contact mechanics; (3) nanoscale imaging.

At SINANO, we're dedicated to advancing precise assembly techniques at the micro- and nano-scale for next generation soft materials and devices. We welcome trainees from various backgrounds, including chemistry, physics, materials science, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and related fields. If you are interested in the beauty of ordered nano-structures and their collective functions, [Email Cheng](mailto:czeng2024@sinano.ac.cn)!
