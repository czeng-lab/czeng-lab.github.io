The Zeng Lab just opened its doors in April 2024 in the [Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics (SINANO)](https://www.sinano.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences. We're dedicated to advancing precise assembly techniques at the micro- and nano-scale for next generation soft materials and electronics. 

We welcome trainees from a variety of backgrounds including chemistry, physics, materials, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and related fields. [Email Dr. Zeng](mailto:czeng2024@sinano.ac.cn) if you are interested in the beauty of ordered nano-structures and their collective functions!
