The Zeng Lab just opened its doors in April 2024 in the [Suzhou Institute of Nano-Tech and Nano-Bionics (SINANO)](https://www.sinano.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences. We're dedicated to advancing precise assembly techniques at the micro- and nano-scale for next generation soft materials and electronics. 

We welcome trainees from a variety of backgrounds including chemistry, physics, materials, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and related fields. [Email Dr. Zeng](mailto:czeng2024@sinano.ac.cn) if you are interested in the beauty of ordered nano-structures and their collective functions!

Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
